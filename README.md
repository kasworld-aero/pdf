Mozilla pdf.js web viewer as an Angular 1.5+ Component

We needed a custom document viewer that could be embedded into our Angular project. I found Mozilla's PDF.js and thought it would be a good fit. The viewer.html was customizable and allowed us to easily tap into several advanced features, such as searching text within the document and entering fullscreen mode. This is the prototype I created to test that the viewer could be embedded and the toolbar functionality could be exposed to outside components. Not perfect by any means, but was a fun learning experience and interesting project.

It is a prototype, so it has its bugs and quirks. Still pretty neat and functional.
